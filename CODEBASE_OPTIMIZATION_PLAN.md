# Codebase Optimization & Refactor Plan

## 1. Code Structure & DRY Refactor

- [ ] **Audit Large Files:**  
  - List all files >300 lines.  
  - Break down into smaller, focused modules (e.g., split data fetching, UI, and business logic).
- [ ] **Extract Repeated Logic:**  
  - Identify repeated code in dashboard, log, and response files.  
  - Move to `/lib` (utilities), `/hooks`, or `/components/shared`.
- [ ] **Centralize Utilities:**  
  - Create/expand `/lib` for validation, formatting, API calls, etc.
- [ ] **Shared Components:**  
  - Move repeated UI (modals, tables, buttons) to `/components/shared` or `/ui`.
- [ ] **Consistent Naming & Structure:**  
  - Standardize file and folder naming across features.

## 2. Security & Validation

- [ ] **Input Validation:**  
  - Ensure all forms validate input on client and server.
  - Use schema validation libraries (e.g., *zod*, *yup*).
- [ ] **Sanitize Data:**  
  - Sanitize user-generated content before rendering.
- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - Protect sensitive routes/pages with middleware.
  - Enforce role-based access in all data operations.
- [ ] **API Security:**  
  - Add rate limiting, secure headers, and enforce HTTPS.
- [ ] **Secrets Management:**  
  - Ensure no secrets are hardcoded; use environment variables.

## 3. Error Handling

- [ ] **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  
  - Add try/catch to async operations.
  - Log errors with context.
  - Show user-friendly error messages.
- [ ] **Async Handling:**  
  - Handle network failures and loading states.

## 4. Performance Optimization

- [ ] **Optimize Expensive Operations:**  
  - Cache/memoize where possible.
  - Implement pagination for large lists.
- [ ] **Prevent Memory Leaks:**  
  - Clean up listeners, cancel requests, clear intervals/timeouts.
- [ ] **Optimize Rendering:**  
  - Use virtualization for long lists, code splitting, and lazy loading.

## 5. Database & API Best Practices

- [ ] **Transactions for Related Operations:**  
  - Use transactions for multi-step DB changes.
- [ ] **Optimize Queries:**  
  - Add indexes, select only needed fields, paginate large queries.
- [ ] **RESTful API Design:**  
  - Use correct HTTP methods, status codes, and consistent response formats.

## 6. Maintainability

- [ ] **Clear Naming:**  
  - Use descriptive, non-abbreviated names.
- [ ] **Documentation:**  
  - Document complex logic and keep docs up-to-date.
- [ ] **Testing:**  
  - Add unit, integration, and E2E tests for critical flows.

## 7. Frontend Specific

- [ ] **Form Validation:**  
  - Validate as users type, show clear errors, handle submission errors.
- [ ] **State Management:**  
  - Use context/hooks for local state, avoid prop drilling.
- [ ] **Accessibility:**  
  - Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast.

## 8. Security Vulnerabilities

- [ ] **Prevent SQL/NoSQL Injection:**  
  - Use parameterized queries/ORM.
- [ ] **Prevent XSS:**  
  - Sanitize input, use framework protections.
- [ ] **Prevent CSRF:**  
  - Use anti-CSRF tokens, validate origins.
- [ ] **Fix Broken Authentication:**  
  - Secure session management, password hashing, strong password policies.
