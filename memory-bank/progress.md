# Progress

## What Works
- **Admin Dashboard** with management features
- **Map** displaying emergencies and contributions
- **Emergency and Contribution Forms** for data submission
- **Basic role-based access** via Supabase
- **Initial Supabase schema** with user policies and content tables
- **AssignmentManager for org_admin**: Org_admin can assign team members to emergency reports and contributions via a dedicated UI (Bahasa Indonesia) under [slug]
- **Assignment workflows**: Only one responder per organization can be assigned to a report/contribution (DB constraint enforced, UI prevents duplicates)
- **Access control**: Only org_admin of the organization can access the dispatcher page
- **ActivityLogTable refactored**: Floating modal, disaster responseâ€“oriented fields, linkage to emergency reports, status logging
- **Status value standardization**: All status fields now use menunggu, diproses, selesai, dibatalkan

## What's Left to Build
- **Responder Dashboard**:
  - Map view with assignment and verification actions (responder-side status update: "Diterima", "Sedang Berjalan", "Selesai")
  - Manual shelter assignment UI (if not yet complete)
- **Status synchronization**:
  - Real-time or near real-time updates across dashboards and map
  - Ensure public map marker modal displays assignment status in the required format ("diproses oleh [namaresponder] [namaorganisasi]", etc.)
- **Organization management**:
  - User and organization profiles (enhancements)
  - Org admins manage their members (enhancements)
- **QA and user testing**:
  - Dispatcher/assignment workflow
  - End-to-end status update flows

## Current Status
- Memory Bank up to date
- AssignmentManager and dispatcher workflow for org_admin implemented and live
- Assignment and access control logic complete
- Activity logging and status value standardization complete
- Preparing for QA, responder-side status update, and further sync improvements

## Known Issues
- No real-time status synchronization yet
- Responder-side status update not yet implemented
- Further organization management enhancements may be needed
